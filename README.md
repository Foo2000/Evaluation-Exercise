# Evaluation Exercise

This repository contains my answers for the GSoC evaluation exercise for the ATLAS Autoencoders project.

The file 'TLA_4D_Example.ipynb' contains the main code, i.e. the code for data handling and running the network on the data.

The file 'data_handling_detailed.ipynb' presents the intermidiate outputs of the data handling steps.
